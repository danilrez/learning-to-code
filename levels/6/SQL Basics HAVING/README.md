# SQL Basics: Simple HAVING

### Details:

For this challenge you need to create a simple **HAVING** statement, you want to count how many people have the same age and return the groups with 10 or more people who have that age.

#### People table schema

| `id` | `name` | `age` |
| ---- | ------ | ----- |
|      |        |       |

#### Return table schema

| `age` | `total_people` |
| ----- | -------------- |
|       |                |

**_NOTE:_** _Your solution should use pure SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases to do the actual testing._
