# Area or Perimeter

### Details:

You are given the `length` and `width` of a 4-sided polygon. The polygon can either be a rectangle or a square.
If it is a square, return its area. If it is a rectangle, return its perimeter.

```javascript
area_or_perimeter(6, 10) --> 32
area_or_perimeter(3, 3) --> 9
```

> **_Note:_** for the purposes of this kata you will assume that it is a square if its length and width are equal, otherwise it is a rectangle.
