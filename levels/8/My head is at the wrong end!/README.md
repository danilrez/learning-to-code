# My head is at the wrong end!

### Details:

You're at the zoo... all the meerkats look weird. Something has gone terribly wrong - someone has gone and switched their heads and tails around!

Save the animals by switching them back. You will be given an array which will have three values _(tail, body, head)_. It is your job to re-arrange the array so that the animal is the right way round _(head, body, tail)_.

Same goes for all the other arrays/lists that you will get in the tests: you have to change the element positions with the same exact logics

Simples!
