# Beginner Series #4 Cockroach

### Details:

The cockroach is one of the fastest insects. Write a function which takes its speed in km per hour and returns it in cm per second, rounded down to the integer _(= floored)_.

#### For example

```javascript
1.08 --> 30
```

Note! The input is a Real number _(actual type is language dependent)_ and is >= 0. The result should be an Integer.
