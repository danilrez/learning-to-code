# Capitalization and Mutability

### Details:

Your coworker was supposed to write a simple helper function to capitalize a string _(that contains a single word)_ before they went on vacation.

Unfortunately, they have now left and the code they gave you doesn't work. Fix the helper function they wrote so that it works as intended _(i.e. make the first character in the string "word" upper case)_.

Don't worry about numbers, special characters, or non-string types being passed to the function. The string lengths will be from 1 character up to 10 characters, but will never be empty.
