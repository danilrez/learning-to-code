# Return Negative

### Details:

In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

#### Example:

```javascript
makeNegative(1); // return -1
makeNegative(-5); // return -5
makeNegative(0); // return 0
makeNegative(0.12); // return -0.12
```

#### Notes:

- The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
- Zero _(0)_ is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.
