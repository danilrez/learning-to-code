# BASIC: Making Six Toast

### Details:

#### Story

You are going to make toast fast, you think that you should make multiple pieces of toasts and once. So, you try to make 6 pieces of toast.

#### Problem

You forgot to count the number of toast you put into there, you don't know if you put exactly six pieces of toast into the toasters.

Define a function that counts how many more _(or less)_ pieces of toast you need in the toasters. Even though you need more or less, the number will still be positive, not negative.

#### Examples

You must return the number of toast the you need to put in _(or to take out)_. In case of `5` you can still put `1` toast in:

```javascript
six_toast(5) == 1;
```

And in case of `12` you need `6` toasts less _(but not `-6`)_:

```javascript
six_toast(12) == 6;
```
