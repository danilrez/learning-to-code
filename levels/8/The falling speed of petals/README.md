# The falling speed of petals

### Details:

When it's spring Japanese cherries blossom, it's called "sakura" and it's admired a lot. The petals start to fall in late April.

Suppose that the falling speed of a petal is 5 centimeters per second _(5 cm/s)_, and it takes 80 seconds for the petal to reach the ground from a certain branch.

Write a function that receives the speed _(in cm/s)_ of a petal as input, and returns the time it takes for that petal to reach the ground **from the same branch**.

#### Notes:

- The movement of the petal is quite complicated, so in this case we can see the velocity as a constant during its falling.
- Pay attention to the data types.
- If the initial velocity is non-positive, the return value should be `0`
