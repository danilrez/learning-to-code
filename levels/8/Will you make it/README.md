# Get the mean of an array

### Details:

You were camping with your friends far away from home, but when it's time to go back, you realize that your fuel is running out and the nearest pump is `50` miles away! You know that on average, your car runs on about `25` miles per gallon. There are `2` gallons left. Considering these factors, write a function that tells you if it is possible to get to the pump or not. Function should return `true` _(1 in Prolog)_ if it is possible and `false` _(0 in Prolog)_ if not. The input values are always positive.
