# String incrementer

### Details:

Your job is to write a function which increments a string, to create a new string.

- If the string already ends with a number, the number should be incremented by 1.
- If the string does not end with a number. the number 1 should be appended to the new string.

#### Examples

```javascript
foo -> foo1
foobar23 -> foobar24
foo0042 -> foo0043
foo9 -> foo10
foo099 -> foo100
```

**_Attention:_** _If the number has leading zeros the amount of digits should be considered._
