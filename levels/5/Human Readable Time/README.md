# Human Readable Time

### Details:

Write a function, which takes a non-negative integer _(seconds)_ as input and returns the time in a human-readable format _(HH:MM:SS)_

- `HH` = hours, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 99
- `MM` = minutes, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59
- `SS` = seconds, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59
  The maximum time never exceeds 359999 _(99:59:59)_

You can find some examples in the test fixtures.
